# Gas Diffusion Simulation in a Budded Cylinder Airway Model of Emphysema
This software simulates diffusion of hyperpolarized gases (e.g. <sup>129</sup>Xe) in a budded cylinder airway model using a
finite difference method.

Switching between healthy and diseased airway values is intended to be used for investigating the behaviour of MRI
measurements between normal lungs and and emphysema.
